This is a project where I get ChatGPT to make a game.
At the same time, I'm trying to identify where ChatGPT will run into challenges, to help with this, I'm modifying the code at certain points to make it more effective.
The commits by chatgpt will be unlabelled. However when I make a change I think helps the 'flow' of the code, I've marked them with [* - Not GPT]. I plan to look over these for later use.
